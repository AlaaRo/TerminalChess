# TerminalChess: Play chess in the CLI
Run the scripts/executables in the terminal by the following syntax:

[PROGRAM_NAME] connect : to connect to the opponent's listener

[PROGRAM_NAME] listen  : to setup a listener waiting for connections

note: brackets mean a parameter, don't type them!

PROGRAM_NAME is either BlackPiecesChess.py or WhitePiecesChess.py

same syntax applies to executables.
